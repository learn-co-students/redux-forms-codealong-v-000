/*
First, we made sure the React component of our application was working. We did this by building a form, and then making sure that whenever the user typed in the form's input, the state was updated.

Second, We connected the component to Redux and designed our mapDispatchToProps

Third, we built our reducer such that it responded to the appropriate event and concatenated the payload into our array of todos.
